          After 2021, Apple Store required apps updating or being put on the app store for the first time to specify privacy labels.

          We collected nearly weekly snapshots of the privacy labels of 1.6+ million apps over the span of a year.

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            The increase from 2021 to 2022 is mainly in new apps which are being published, where the privacy label is just an obstacle to the goal of adding an app to the app store.

              Our research found that existing apps that voluntarily updated their privacy labels -- without a version update -- included more details about their data collection practices.

              50% of older apps that added a label with a version update simply stated they donâ€™t collect any data.

            When comparing paid vs. free apps, more free apps report data collection and tracking than those you pay for, perhaps reflecting additional revenue streams from free apps in targeted advertising and/or selling user data.

            The large audience increases the surveillance surplus, which may make it harder for app sellers to resist collecting a wider range of data to increase profits. Therefore, popular apps reflect more data collection compared to less popular apps.

            According to the privacy labels, larger apps collect and track more user data. This may be due to the fact that apps with larger footprints contain additional software libraries for the purpose of collecting data.
